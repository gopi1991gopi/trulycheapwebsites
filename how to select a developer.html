                  Finding the right web developer to take your business online can be a daunting task anywhere in the world, but here in India, it can be a nightmare. If you have published your requirement on a public group, or worse, if you have made your WhatsApp number public, developers swarm the space with their rates. So, How do you choose one?

                </p>

                <p>
                  You will get quotes from as little as INR 500 to as large as INR 50000. And the best part? They don't know you or your business yet. The problem is, anyone can make a website nowadays. But web development is a continuous process that requires good dialogue between the developer and the business owner. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   Here are five tips that we think can help you with web development.

                </p>

                <h3>Get the website done yourself.</h3>
                <p>
                  You know your business and its customers better than anyone else. Any website development goes through a process of multiple iterations, changing a text here, putting a new button there, and so on. If you can develop the website yourself, the changes will be implemented faster, and the to and fro-ing between development and subsequent analysis will be a lot less painful. 
                  And you don’t have to be a computer geek to get started with web design. There are a lot of choices like WordPress, Google Sites, and tons of other drag and drop website builders that you can use to put your business online. Once your site is set up with one of these builders and connected to a custom domain like www.mycoolbusiness.com  , then you will need next to zero coding skills to develop your website.  
                </p>
                <img src="assets/img/blog-inside-post.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                <p>
                  However, these builders can be limited in some of their functionality, but the good thing is that you will have an up-and-running website that gets business done for you. Also, when it is time for you to scale up your business website and include more functionality, you have your entire source code and know-how with you, which can be used as a starting point for further development. 
                </p>

                <p>

                </p>

                 <p>
                  Okay, you know how to develop a website, but may lack either the free time or the patience to build one for you. Sometimes you might want the website to have features that are currently out of your grasp in web development. Or perhaps you just don't want to take another additional burden upon you. The next best thing, in such situations, is to hire an agency or a freelancer to do the job for you. 
                </p>

                <h3>Shortlist developers with business understanding.</h3>
                <p>
                  This is the most important question to ask, as this determines the value that you can expect from the developer in the short term, and also the benefits of the web presence that accrues to your business in the long term.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Start by asking a few relevant questions to the developer. For example, if you are planning to build a website for your furniture mart, ask the developer(s) about how an online presence will help bring more customers to you, and which channels are more beneficial. No developer will know the business inside-out, but with experience and skill, they will be able to identify some areas in which you should be focussing your development because of the nature of your business. This will help you cut down on the web development budget and also increase the return on your investment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hiring a developer who knows your business is critical for your scaling-up plans too. Going forward, you might have plans to include more features or add more functionality to your website. Any web development involves analysis and those who don’t analyze even their pixel-perfect websites periodically are living in a fool’s paradise. Only a developer who knows your business will be able to help you with the analysis. You can, of course, do that yourself, but that beats the purpose of you hiring someone to help you with the web in the first place.
                </p>
                <h3>Go through the developer’s own website.</h3>
                <p>
                  Take a list of developers whom you think have sufficient knowledge about your business. Go through their own websites carefully. A web developer’s own website speaks a lot about their quality and you can expect it to flow out into your website too.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Especially look for links or buttons that don’t work or some placeholder text that is left on the site. These affect the user experience on the site to a great extent, and if they have been overlooked by the developer, chances are that they do not have the attention to detail that is required in this field. Customer experience is everything. You don’t want a customer to open your About tab and see: “"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing eli.” You have nothing to do with lorem ipsum.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To do a quick check for such place holder texts in completed sites, type   site:www.mycoolbusiness.com "lorem ipsum" on Google search bar.
                </p>
                <h3>Analyze the testimonial websites.</h3>
                <p>
                  Many web developers and agencies will showcase good customer reviews or testimonials on their website. Search Google for these websites and go through them. All website owners might not be willing to talk about their experience with the web developer, but if someone is, do talk to them about how smoothly the process went, the kind of support that the developer/agency showed after the website was created, etc. This can give you some realistic perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We are not talking about 100% positive reviews here, but the general experience. Some web developers or agencies may quote one rate in the beginning and then as the work progresses, keep on hiking the charges. Usually, this results in a poorly made website or an infuriated client. Either way, looking at the client website is the easiest way to know such things. 

                </p>
                <p>
                  There might be cases where the client has defaulted on the payments and therefore the client website is incomplete. In situations like these, it would be better for a developer or an agency to not quote the website as their creation. 
                </p>
                 <h3>Freelancer or agency?</h3>
                <p>
                  Finally, if you are lucky enough to encounter equally knowledgeable freelancers and agencies, choosing between them can sometimes be a matter of cost. If your project involves local solutions only, it might be better to go for freelancers as they tend to have lower costs. However, if you want a multi-cultural approach, or if you want features that cut across different areas of development like logo design, user experience design etc, it might be better to go for agencies that have a strong team.
